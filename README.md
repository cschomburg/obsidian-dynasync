## DynaSync

**WIP: this is currently very experimental**

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to sync selected files with [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io).

## Notes

This plugin aims to provide a small bridge between Obsidian and Dynalist, to
synchronize a few selected files between them - just as a crutch until a better
mobile app for Obsidian comes along.

My use case consists of tracking my Inbox, Reminders and To Do list in Dynalist
where I can easily access them in the Dynalist mobile app, and syncing them to
my full knowledge base in Obsidian.

This plugin will never sync a whole vault, nor strife to be a 100% perfect
lossless sync solution.

## Roadmap

- [x] manually download a Dynalist file
- [ ] manually upload a Dynalist file
- [ ] auto-sync for selected files

## Out of scope

- syncing whole vault
- handling larger files than simple checklists
- conflict resolution, line diffing
- link rewriting
